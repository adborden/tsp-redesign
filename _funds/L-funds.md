Fund_objective: The L Funds’ investment objective is to strike an optimal balance between the expected risk and return associated with each fund. Any other use of the L Funds may result in a greater amount of risk in your portfolio than is necessary in order to achieve the same expected rate of return. Each quarter, the L Funds' target asset allocations change, moving towards a less risky mix of investments as the target date approaches. So if you are invested in one of the L Funds, you’ll notice that as you get closer to your target date, your allocation to the riskier TSP funds will get smaller while your allocation to the more conservative G Fund gets larger.
questions:
  - question: Why should I invest in the L Funds?
    answer: The L Funds, or Lifecycle Funds, offer a simple, low maintenance way of investing money in your TSP account by using an appropriate mix of the G, F, C, S, and I Funds that most closely matches your time horizon, or target retirement date. As your target date approaches, the investment mix of each L Fund becomes more conservative (less risky), and it is automatically adjusted for you.
  - question: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?
    answer: When you invest in the L Funds, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. This means that the L Funds can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.
  - question: How can I use the L Funds in my TSP?
    answer: Putting your entire TSP account [into one of the](#) L Funds (i.e., the L Income, L 2020, L 2030, L 2040, L 2050, etc.) will help you to achieve the best expected return for the amount of expected risk that is appropriate for your time horizon. The L Funds make the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance - it’s done for you.

additional_info: |
  Our Lifecycle (L) Funds are designed to meet the investment needs of our participants with different time horizons. The five L Funds were created just for us by an investment consultant. The asset allocations are based on the investment consultant’s assumptions regarding future investment returns, inflation, economic growth, and interest rates. We review these assumptions at least annually to determine whether changes to the allocations are warranted.

  Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There’s no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the funds' historical returns, visit [Share Price History](#). Keep in mind, that past performance does not guarantee future results.
risks: |
  When you invest in the L Funds, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. Your account is not guaranteed against loss. The L Funds can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.
rewards: |
  The L Funds simplify fund selection. You choose the fund that is closest to your target date (or, if your target date falls between the target dates that are offered, you can split your account between the two target date funds closest to your time horizon).

  When you invest in the L Funds:

  - You can be sure that your TSP account is broadly diversified.
  - You don't have to remember to adjust your investment mix as your target date approaches - it's done for you.
