# Annuity basics

A life annuity provides guaranteed monthly payments for as long as you are alive. Your life annuity can also pay benefits to a survivor, or joint annuitant if you want. The TSP life annuity is one of the full withdrawal options that are available to you once you have left the federal government or the uniformed services.
