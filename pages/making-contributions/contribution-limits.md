# Know your limits

Here at the TSP, we like to keep our participants informed, so we’ve done a little
work for you. The 2018 Contributions Limits are below, along with additional
information to help you make informed decisions.

## Age 50 and over
This year, on top of the $18,500 regular limit to a retirement plan,
like the Thri Savings Plan, participants **50 and older can add
$6000 per year** in catch-up contributions.

The additional savings could amount to an **additional $1,000
per month once you’ve entered retirement.** Contributions are
also tax-free, but keep in mind that withdrawals are taxed as
income in retirement.

retirement savings accounts, including contribution limits for
401(k), 403(b), and most 457 plans, as well as income limits for
IRA contribution deductibility.

**These limits don’t include the matching contribution you
may receive from your employer.** You get an **immediate tax
break**, because contributions come out of your paycheck before
taxes are withheld. There’s the possibility of a matching
contribution from your employer.

And you get **tax-deferred growth** — meaning you don’t pay
taxes each year on capital gains, dividends, and other
distributions.

of $18,500** to help reach your retirement savings goals.

## All Ages
The annual addition is the total dollar amount contributed in a
given year to a participant’s retirement account under a defined contribution
plan (DC plan). This **annual addition limit is the
lesser of 100% of the participant’s compensation for the year**
or the dollar limit in effect for the year.

When you begin with the federal government, **you must wait
three years years to begin receiving annual additions** to your
retirement plan. Although you can begin contributing sooner,
this benefit is oen delayed to ensure that employees stays in
the position long enough to begin adding value. This period is
called vesting. This information is on your TSP account on your
TSP **statement** for your convenience.
