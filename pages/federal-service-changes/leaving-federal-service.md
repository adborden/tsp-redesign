# Leaving federal service

You don't need to do anything with your TSP account when you leave federal or uniformed service. It will stay right where it is (if your balance is $200 or more), and you'll continue to enjoy potential earnings and our very low administrative fees. While you will no longer be able to make employee contributions, you'll still be able to transfer money into your TSP account from traditional IRAs and other eligible employer plans and change the way your money is invested in the TSP funds by making interfund transfers.

If youâ€™re separating from federal or uniformed service, there are two important things you must do:

1. Make sure we have your current address at all times. Once you're gone, you can change it yourself under "[Profile Settings](#)" in My Account.
2. If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
