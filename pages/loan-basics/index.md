# Loan basics

If youâ€™re employed by the federal government or are a member of the uniformed services, the TSP allows you to borrow from your retirement savings via a TSP loan. And while TSP loans generally have fewer fees than commercial loans, you should consider the effect of taking out a TSP loan on your retirement savings.

When you take a TSP loan, you borrow from your TSP account. That means you are missing out on the [compound earnings](glossary term) from those savings had they remained in your account. Before taking out a loan, consider doing a cost-benefit analysis or using one of our calculators to determine if taking out a TSP loan is right for you.
