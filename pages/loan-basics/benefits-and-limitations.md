# Benefits and limitations

Before taking out a loan, you should carefully consider its potential effect on your retirement income.

## Borrowing limits

#### Minimum loan amount
The minimum loan amount that you can borrow is $1,000. The amount of your account balance that consists of your own contributions and earnings on those contributions, must be at least equal to the minimum loan amount. 

#### Maximum loan amount
The maximum loan amount that you can borrow is the smallest of the following:
+ Your own contributions and earnings on those contributions in the TSP account from which you intend to borrow, not including any outstanding loan balance;
+ Approximately 50% of your vested account balance (including any outstanding loan balance) or $10,000, whichever is greater, minus any outstanding loan balance; or
+ Approximately $50,000 minus your highest outstanding loan balance, if any, during the last 12 months. Even if your loan is currently paid in full, it will still be considered in the calculation if it was open at any time during the last 12 months.

Note: If you have both a civilian account and a uniformed services account, the combined account balances and outstanding loan amounts will be used to calculate the maximum loan amount. 

TSP account balances are recalculated at the end of each business day based on daily share prices. As a result, the maximum loan amount may change on a daily basis.

## Loan costs

#### Direct costs

_**Loan Fee**_ We charge a loan fee of $50 for administrative expenses. This fee is deducted from your loan proceeds. For example, if you request a loan for $1,000, the amount paid to you will be $950.
 
_**Interest**_ The interest rate on your loan is the G Fund rate at the time your loan application is processed. This rate is fixed for the life of the loan. Although loan interest is not tax-deductible, all of the interest goes back into your TSP account.

#### Indirect costs
When you take a loan, you sacrifice the earnings that might have accrued on the borrowed money, had it remained in your TSP account.
 
Although you pay the loan amount back to your account with interest, the amount of interest paid may be less than what you might have earned if the money had remained in your TSP account.
