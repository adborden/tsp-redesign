# Estate planning

Your estate is comprised of everything you own, including your TSP account. Making an estate plan ensures that your possessions are given to the people or organizations you care about most when you die. Itâ€™s a good idea to review your estate plan periodically, especially if your family or marital status changes. You may be changing jobs, getting married, or moving to another military base. All of these are great reasons to revisit your plan for your TSP account.
