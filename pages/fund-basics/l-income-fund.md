# L Income Fund
## Lifecycle Income Fund
**First, let’s answer a few questions:**

**Q1: Why should I invest in the L Income Fund?**

A1: TSP participants who are currently withdrawing their TSP accounts in monthly payments or who plan to begin withdrawing before 2019 should consider investing in the L Income Fund.

**Q2: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?**

A2: When you invest in the L Income Fund, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. This means that the L Income Fund can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.  

**Q3: How can I use the L Income Fund in my TSP Account?**

A3: Your investment in the L Income Fund will help you to achieve the best expected return for the amount of expected risk that is appropriate for your time horizon. The L Income Fund makes the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance - it’s done for you. 

**Fund overview (Objective):**

The L Income Fund’s investment objective is to achieve a low level of growth with a high emphasis on preservation of assets. Unlike the other four L Funds, the L Income Fund's asset allocation does not change quarterly. However, like the other funds, it is rebalanced daily to maintain its target investment mix.

  **Other Expense:**

*An expense ratio of .033% translates to 3.3 basis points or $0.33 per $1,000 account balance.

**Fees associated with securities lending are not included in 2017 administrative expenses. Consistent with standard practice in the industry, they are charged in addition to administrative
expenses. The other expenses represent fees paid to the investment manager for administering securities lending programs. Income earned from these programs improved the returns of the fund.

**Additional Information:**

The L Income Fund is designed to produce current income for TSP participants who are already receiving money from their accounts through monthly payments and for participants who plan to withdraw or to begin withdrawing from their accounts before 2019. The asset allocations are based on the investment consultant’s assumptions regarding future investment returns, inflation, economic growth, and interest rates. The TSP reviews these assumptions at least annually to determine whether changes to the allocations are warranted. 

Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the L Income Fund’s historical returns, visit “Learn about fund options” at tsp.gov. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
