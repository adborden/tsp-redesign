# L Funds
## Lifecycle Funds
**First, let’s answer a few questions:**

**Q1: Why should I invest in the L Funds?**

A1: The L Funds, or Lifecycle Funds, offer a simple, low maintenance way of investing money in your TSP account by using an appropriate mix of the G, F, C, S, and I Funds that most closely matches your time horizon, or target retirement date. As your target date approaches, the investment mix of each L Fund becomes more conservative (less risky), and it is automatically adjusted for you.

**Q2: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?**

A2: When you invest in the L Funds, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. This means that the L Funds can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do. 

**Q3: How can I use the L Funds in my TSP Account?**

A3: Putting your entire TSP account into one of the L Funds (i.e., the L Income, L 2020, L 2030, L 2040, L 2050, etc.) will help you to achieve the best expected return for the amount of expected risk that is appropriate for your time horizon. The L Funds make the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance - it’s done for you. 

**Fund overview (Objective):**

The L Funds’ investment objective is to strike an optimal balance between the expected risk and return associated with each fund. Any other use of the L Funds may result in a greater amount of risk in your portfolio than is necessary in order to achieve the same expected rate of return.

Each quarter, the L Funds' target asset allocations change, moving towards a less risky mix of investments as the target date approaches. So if you are invested in one of the L Funds, you’ll notice that as you get closer to your target date, your allocation to the riskier TSP funds will get smaller while your allocation to the more conservative G Fund gets larger.

**Other Expense:**

*An expense ratio of .033% translates to 3.3 basis points or $0.33 per $1,000 account balance.

**Fees associated with securities lending are not included in 2017 administrative expenses. Consistent with standard practice in the industry, they are charged in addition to administrative
expenses. The other expenses represent fees paid to the investment manager for administering securities lending programs. Income earned from these programs improved the returns of the fund.

**Additional Information:**

Our Lifecycle (L) Funds are designed to meet the investment needs of our participants with different time horizons. The five L Funds were created just for us by an investment consultant. The asset allocations are based on the investment consultant’s assumptions regarding future investment returns, inflation, economic growth, and interest rates. We review these assumptions at least annually to determine whether changes to the allocations are warranted.

Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There’s no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the funds' historical returns, visit Share Price History. Keep in mind, that past performance does not guarantee future results.
