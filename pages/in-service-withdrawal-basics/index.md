# In-service withdrawal basics

In-service withdrawals are withdrawals you make from your TSP account while you are still actively employed in Federal service or a member of the uniformed services. An in-service withdrawal can have a __serious impact__ on your TSP account. Remember that the purpose of your account is to accumulate savings so that you will have income during retirement.

### Things to consider:

+ Withdrawals permanently reduce your TSP savings as well as any earnings you could have earned on those savings
+ Withdrawals may be subject to income taxes
+ If you take a financial hardship withdrawal, you will not be able to make contributions to your account for 6 months. If you receive any agency-matching contributions, those will also stop for 6 months.
+ If you are a married FERS participant or a member of the uniformed services, your spouse must sign a consent waiver for your in-service withdrawal.
