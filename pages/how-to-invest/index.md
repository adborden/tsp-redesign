# How to invest

The TSP offers an array of investment options for your retirement. You can choose your own mix of investments from short-term U.S. Treasury security to index funds comprised of domestic and international stocks. Or, if you prefer, you can choose one of our “Lifecycle” L Funds that use professionally determined investment mixes designed to deliver a balanced approach to investing based on when you plan to retire.
